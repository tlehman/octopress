Just last night I had the pleasure of seeing [Phil Plait](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/) of Bad Astronomy fame. Before the show had started, I was looking up the U.S. and Earth Populations for trivia's sake, and my friend noticed that the Earth's population was approaching 314,159,265, at a rate of 13 people per second.

This morning I decided to whip up a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) app that computes the amount of time until this moment occurs, it is right here <http://pop-pi.herokuapp.com>. Right now, as I am writing this, there is 1 hour and 45 minutes left.

Before lunch today, there will be 10<sup>8</sup>&pi; people in the United States. There is of course no significance to this, it's just pattern my brain won't let me ignore.
