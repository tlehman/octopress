I used to hate the phrase "throwing your vote away.". This is usually
used in response to people voting for someone who is probably not going
to win. Even though we have [five major parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States#Major_political_parties) in the United States, chances are, the winner is going to either a Republican or a Democrat. 

The reason I hated that phrase so much is that it discourages people
from voting for their ideal candidate for pragmatic reasons. Chances
are, a non-Democrat, non-Republican is not going to win, so cut your
losses and pick a candidat that you *dislike least*.

However, as I've gotten slightly older, I have come to appreciate how
necessary comprimise is.
