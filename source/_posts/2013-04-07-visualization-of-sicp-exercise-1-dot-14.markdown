I am currently working my way the [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](https://github.com/tlehman/sicp-exercises#readme)
and I've skipped past exercise 1.14, and come back to it after a bit
of thinking, here's the problem, and then the exercise.

*The Problem*: How many ways are there to make change of a given
 `amount` with the following kinds of coins?

 - pennies
 - nickels
 - dimes 
 - quarters
 - half-dollars
