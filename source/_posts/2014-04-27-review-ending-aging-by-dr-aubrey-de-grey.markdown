I just finished reading [Dr. Aubrey de Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey)'s _Ending Aging:  The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime (2007)_, it was an accessible introduction to a possible way that aging could be defeated. Now, I'm by default skeptical about anti-aging techniques or some fountain of youth. That is why I read the book, I've heard de Gray's idea on a podcast, and watched his TED talk. It sounded reasonable, but I wanted to learn more about the science to have a more informed opinion.

After reading the book, I think it is a plausible plan for an approach to reverse the effects of aging. I'll summarize the idea and highlight some things from the book that weren't covered in de Gray's TED talk or podcast interview.

The central assumption of the book is that aging is the accumulation of seven types of damage:

 1. Mitochondrial DNA mutations
 1. Nuclear DNA mutations
 1. Intercellular junk
 1. Extracellular junk
 1. Glycation
 1. Cells not dying when they are supposed to
 1. Cells dying when they are not supposed to
