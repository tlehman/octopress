Driving drunk is illegal for a good reason, it's way riskier than driving sober. This article isn't about driving drunk 
though, it's more about the sloppy thought processes that can too easily confuse something as obvious as that first 
sentence. I saw this great tweet recently:

From a recent talk: 1/3 of accidents involve drunk drivers, so 2/3 don’t =&gt; sober drivers 2× as bad.</p>

So the argument is as follows: In 2012, 10,322 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes,
accounting for nearly one-third (31%) of all traffic-related deaths in the United States. That means that approximately 
one third of traffic-related deaths involve drunk driving.
