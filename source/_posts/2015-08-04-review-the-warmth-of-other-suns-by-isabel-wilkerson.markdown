Isabel Wilkerson's riveting book about the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the south is the perfect blend of narrative and statisitcs.
The personal stories of Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, George Swanson Starling and Robert Joseph Pershing Foster are the substantive bulk of the book. Around these personal stories are statistics that serve to add context and clarity to a movement that was so large, and took place over a long enough time, that it's easy to miss it as a distinct historical period.

This book was my introduction to the Great Migration. It was a migration that began in 1915 with World War 1 and ended around 1970.

This began to change in a big way during World War 1, since the men that left for war in the north left a labor vacuum. Recruiters from the north would go south, trying to convince many black residents in the south to move north for jobs. This was just the beginning, since the family and friends of those first migrants kept that route in their minds as a possible option for a better life.

The book proceeds by moving through three parallel timelines, one of Ida Mae, a sharecropper's wife from Missippi, who left in the 1930s. Then George Starling
