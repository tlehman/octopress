I am a programmer and a (late-blooming) math enthusiast. I grew up in the beautiful [San Juan Islands](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=san+juan+islands&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x548f7c056c64923d:0x79e31327e7db0fb2,San+Juan+Island&gl=us&ei=ZiT6T5HLNcfJqgGEnYGLCQ&sqi=2&ved=0CL0BELYD) and currently live in Portland, Oregon with my lovely girlfriend, Emily.

I work as a software developer at [Goldstar Events](http://www.goldstar.com/), and I have a B.S. in Mathematics from [Portland State University](http://pdx.edu).

If you would like to contact me, send me an email at `my first name` dot `my last name` at gmail dot com. Or follow me on twitter: [@habitmelon](http://twitter.com/habitmelon)
